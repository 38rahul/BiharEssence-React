===========   Lifecycle of a Class based Component ==============

How the component Loaded in the webPage
How the component MOUNTED IN THE WEBPAGE ??

Loading the componenton the web page  = Mounting the component on the web page


How the Life cycle of Class Based Component works??

==> Assume we have About Class Based component and inside that we have use User Class Based Component.
==> Once we naviagte to about page then About class will be instantiated.
Hence, Constructor will be called follwed with render method.

Then inside render method you have used User Component then User will be instantiated Hence User Constructor will be called and then render method of User class will be called


Hence Order of Invocation is as Follows:

About Constructor -> About Render method -> User Constructor -> User render method

=========ComponentDidMount() =============

==> invocation in a Parent Child Relationship

About.js     parent constructor
About.js:34  parent render
UserClass.js:16  Child constructor
UserClass.js:35  Child render
UserClass.js:24 Child Component Did mount
About.js:20 Parent Component Did mount

Constructor 
Render 
COmponent Did mount

why and what is componentDidMount ?
-> it is used to make API calls. But why API call is made inside componentDidMount ??

In react component if you make an API call, we want to render the component once and make an Api call and then fill the Data inside the component.

we don't want to wait for API to return the Data to render the component.

Otherwise the component will not render and it will keep on waiting for the data to come from API.

This way our Application seems to be fast.
you can use Shimmer UI so that later component will be filled witht he data.


==> React wants to quickly render it then make an API call and then fill/render the data.

======================1:34 min-=====================


1: 44 min
Watch this again to build your Life cycle Foundation Strong


There is a Difference between: Mount Update and UnMount.


componentDidUpdate() is called after every update similar to useEffect Hook

=============2:17 min ==========

Question: When will componentDidMount() called/used ??---
-> when we are leaving the page/component and moving to other component.
Example --> I'm moving from about page to contact us Page.

    -> Cleanup
    -> what kind of CleanUp ??



Research Topics
1: why do we write constructor props and  super props in Class Based Component.
2: async componentDidMount()


=========== 2 Innovative Ideas which we can bring into our Front End React Code Base=========

1: Shimmer UI --> Showing the Boxes before data loads.
2: Lazy loading Similar to Swiggy restaurant Loads
